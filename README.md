# Flyte-HelloWorld
## k nearest neighbour using Flyte

This example shows how [Flyte](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/getting_started/index.html), a Machine Learning orchestration platform is used to implement k-nearest neighbours using Python. 
The fundamental building blocks of Flyte are ``tasks`` and ``workflows``. [Tasks](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/cookbook/en/latest/auto/core/flyte_basics/task.html) are Python functions and [workflows](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/cookbook/en/latest/auto/core/flyte_basics/basic_workflow.html) provide an order of execution of the tasks.
